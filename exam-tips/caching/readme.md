#Â Caching
## Concepts

Caching is when a data is stored in fast access area (RAM) so that future requests for that data can be served faster; the data stored in a cache might be the result of an earlier computation or a copy of data stored elsewhere.

As soon as you can respond a request, less latency the client will have. C**aching is always a balance between up-to-date, accurate information and latency.**
