# AWS Directory Service
## Concepts

**AWS Directory Service** for Microsoft Active Directory, also known as AWS Managed Microsoft Active Directory (AD), enables your **directory-aware workloads and AWS resources to use managed Active Directory (AD)** in AWS. AWS Managed Microsoft AD is built on actual Microsoft AD and does not require you to synchronize or replicate data from your existing Active Directory to the cloud. 

You can use the standard AD administration tools and take advantage of the built-in AD features, such as Group Policy and single sign-on. With AWS Managed Microsoft AD, you can easily join Amazon EC2 and Amazon **RDS for SQL Server** instances to your domain, and use AWS End User Computing (EUC) services, such as Amazon WorkSpaces, with AD users and groups.
