# IAM
## Essentials Tips

### General
* IAM is universal. It applies to all the regions
* Root account is the account created when you open an account. It has full access to any resource inside your account.
* New users have not permissions when their are created.
* Every new user is created with an Access Key ID (like a user id) and a Secret Access Key (like the password) to be used in programmatic access (like API or CLI). They cannot be used to access the console. 
* Secret Key only can be downloaded once. If you lose it, you need to create a new Access ID & Secret.
* You need to setup multi-factor authentication for root and admin accounts.
* You should create password policies (content and rotation)
