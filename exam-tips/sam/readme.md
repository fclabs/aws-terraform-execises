# Serverless Application Model (SAM)

## Concepts

The AWS **Serverless Application Model (AWS SAM)** is an **open-source framework** that you can use to **build serverless applications** on AWS.

A **serverless** application is a **combination of Lambda functions, event sources, and other resources that work together to perform tasks**. Note that a serverless application is more than just a Lambda function—it can include additional resources such as APIs, databases, and event source mappings.

AWS SAM consists of the following components:
* **AWS SAM template specification** - It provides you with a simple and clean syntax to describe the functions, APIs, permissions, configurations, and events that make up a serverless application. 
* **AWS SAM command line interface (AWS SAM CLI)** - You use this tool to build serverless applications that are defined by AWS SAM templates. The CLI provides commands that enable you to verify that AWS SAM template files are written according to the specification, invoke Lambda functions locally, step-through debug Lambda functions, package and deploy serverless applications to the AWS Cloud, and so on. 

## Exam Tips
* **SAM** - It makes easy to **define and deploy serverless applications**.
* **SAM** creates and execute a template fo **CloudFormation** from the CLI.
